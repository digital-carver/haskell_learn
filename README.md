Haskell scripts I write as I learn the language (corrections and code reviews are welcome) 

My learning started with [these helpful slides](http://shuklan.com/haskell/index.html) from the University of Virginia (credits and thanks to Nishant Shukla) and most programs here are exercises from that course. 

http://learnyouahaskell.com/ has also been helpful with some missing pieces, as have http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/ and https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/index.html.
